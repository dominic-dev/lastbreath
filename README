 Notes on styling:
   Some styling is needed for the plugin to work. This is not covered
   in the javascript following as I don't like it that way. See the example
   that came with this file for ideas on styling.
   I will cover the necessities here. 

   The list of items is wrapped in a div with class of "slideshow_wrap"
   this div will need a fixed height and width, overflow set to hidden,
   and position set to relative
   E.g.:
     .slideshow_wrap{
       height:200px;
       width:400px;
       overflow:hidden;
       position:relative;
     }

   The list items themselves need to be displayed as "inline-block" and set to
   an absolute position.
   E.g.:
     ul.my-list li{
       display: inline-block;
       position: absolute;
     }

   The bullets are contained in a div with class "bullets", the anchor tag of the
   bullet corresponding to the current image is given a class of "active-slide".
